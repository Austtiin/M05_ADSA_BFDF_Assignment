//Question 1.
//Describe differences between breadth-first and depth-first searches
//and provide a sequence for each of the searches for the following graph:
//
// A
// / \
//B C
/// / \
//D E F
//
//Question 2.
//For the graphs shown below, provide at least 2 BFS and 2 DFS Traversal Paths for each.
//See the starting nodes in bold below for each graph.
//
//Left Graph
//1. BFS : 1
//2. BFS : 4
//1. DFS : 1
//2. DFS : 4
//
//Right Graph
//1. BFS : 1
//2. BFS : 10
//1. DFS : 1
//2. DFS : 10

//We will seperate the code into two classes, one for the graph and one for the main method.
//The graph class will contain the graph and the methods to traverse the graph.
//The main class will contain the main method to run the program.
//

//Although this is a written assignment, we will also run the program to show the output. And we will also provide the output in the written assignment.
//WE will also provide the output in the written assignment instead of a word document.
